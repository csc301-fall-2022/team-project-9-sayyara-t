# Sayyara

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
