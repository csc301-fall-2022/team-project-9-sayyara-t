## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 11th, 2022
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 1. The first important decision that turned out well was to seperate our group into back-end and font-end teams. This decision turned out well because every member was able to work efficiently and provide value, since we seperated work into clear-cut, independent components. For example, while the back-end was creating models, migrations, and the first batch of APIs, the front-end team was able to work on and design the UX with mock data, allowing all members of the team to be of use.
 2. Another important decision that turned out well was to categorize sections/features of the product. This decision turned out well because it allowed us to highlight our milestone and better make note of the work we finished and the work we still had to do. Furthermore, it allowed the back-end to create batches of APIs for the front-end to integrate with, helping us work more efficiently.
 3. One last important decision that allowed our group to work effectively was our decision to let the front-end decide the data they would need to display, and the back-end the models that were needed to supplement said data. This turned out to be a successful decision for our group since we were not able to meet as a full group often, meaning we needed our teams to work semi-independently of each other with minimal consultation. By letting the front-end decide the data they'd need, and the back-end decide the models and APIs to send said data, our group was able to work more effectively.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 1. One major decision that turned out to be unsuccessful was to start Deliverable 2 at the start of Reading Week. While our production of the application was delayed due to things out of our control, such as initially being paired with 2 other groups and the client's original large scope, our group still started Deliverable 2 late due to midterm season and a lack of foresight. This ultimately resulted in us doing a one week SPRINT for Deliverable 2, meaning a lot of stressed and unhappy developers, making this decision unsuccessful.
 2. Another decision that turned out to be unsuccessful was our lack of meetings as a whole group. While the group worked well despite this issue, one major impact this decision had was a large misunderstanding in the prioritization and specifications of features. For example, while the front-end assumed the group would be able to implement sorting shops by distance, the back-end ultimately felt as if investing time in utilizing the agreed Google Maps API was unwise compared to the other APIs that needed to be finished, meaning halfway through the deliverable front-end had to remove their sort by distance functionality for this deliverable. This decision was ultimately unsuccessful because it led to miscommunication and wrong expectations between teams.
 3. One last decision that turned out to be unsuccessful was not planning a concrete way of integrating the front-end and back-end. While the front-end and back-end teams worked efficiently independent of each other, they did not share any group members and thus we initially had some issues with integrating the server and client side of the application. We resolved this issue by deciding to move some back-end team members to assist the front-end with API integration once our the APIs were all finished, and by integrating in regards to batches of APIs. However, this decision was still unsuccessful as the lack of planning and foresight made our group less efficient.  


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 * The most important change we need to make as a group is to meet more frequently to plan out our workflow, and then commit to working on the project. One big issue we faced as a group for Deliverable 2 was how infrequent we met as a complete group and also our tardiness in starting and working on the project. In the future, we plan not to do an entire Deliverable within a couple of days, but to do small, manageable pieces weekly. Furthermore, another issue our group faced was not meeting frequently as an entire group. We realize that it is unreasonable to always meet as an entire group due to conflicting schedules, so to help resolve the miscommunication and fault expectations between teams, our meetings in the future will always include members from each team.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
