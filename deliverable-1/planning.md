# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.   That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

## Process Details

#### Q6: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

| Name      | Role | Responsibilities | Strengths | Weakness
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | -----------
| Ling    | Title       |
| Brian   | Scrum Master|
| Kevin   |             |
| Harry   |             |
| Tehilla | DevOps      |
| Bradley |             |
| Daniel  | Client Communicator |


#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?
 * Our group will have weekly meetings in the Thursday tutorial sessions, and if the alloted time on Zoom is insuffient, all conversations should be carried forward to our Discord server. In the weeks before a deliverable or a major milestone, we will have up to 2 additional meetings per week at a time most convinient for everyone. All meetings will be hosted online, unless otherwise planned with the agreement of all group members. 
 * The weekly meeting serves as a sync between all group members to keep track of progress and answer potential questions. These should not be deeply technical in nature. If technical meetings are required then they will be scheduled through our Discord server at a convinient time. 
 * In our project partner meetings, we primarily clarified on the way this project is set up to be built by multiple teams simutanously. We proposed plans for functionality seperation and this was ultimated accepted by the partner as the overarching structure for this project going forward. In addition, the partner explained user stories in detail, granting us deeper understanding in the problem we are trying to address. Partner expectations and project specifications have also be discussed in these meetings. 
  
#### Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * **How do you prioritize tasks?**
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?

#### Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

The general culture and atmosphere should be generally casual. 

**Communications:**
 * The group is expected to meet at least once a week to discuss current progress. Outside of the Thursday tutorial sessions on Zoom, all communication should go through Discord. These intra-group communication can be casual as long as they are polite and respectful.
 * For communicating with our partner, we will primarily be using Discord. Should an occasion arise where a discussion with the partner is required, one person from the group can ping the partner through Discord and set up a time. All group members should participate in partner meetings. These discussions should be strictly professional. 
 
**Meetings:**
 * All group members are expected to attend all meetings, and should be available on Discord most of the time. Occasionally missing meetings and messages are acceptable as long as any potential absences are communicated to the group beforehand. In the case of repeated neglegence, the missing member's participation will be noted in group surveys and will be reflected in participation marks throughout the project duration.
